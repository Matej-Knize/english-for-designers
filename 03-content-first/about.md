# About me

Long story short, I am former civil engeneer who found passion in creative work.

My journey started on high school, where I became interested in creating of new things and later I went to Architecture college. There I completely realized, that I want be a creator in my life, and I want to make people happy through the things I create. But probably the fate turned me away from the path of architecture a I had to find new way, how to bring happines into people lives.

***And that's where animation comes in my way.***
