# My work

I love to make animations in all ways. <br>
I have started this journey with 2D and now I'm most into the 3D stuff where I have less limitations and can create literally anything I can imagine.<br>


****

***There are samples of my 2D animations from school work.***


  <img src="images/ball.gif" width="450" height="600" alt="the walk cycle of baseball ball with red cap" >  <img src="images/bat.gif" width="400" height="600" alt="the walk cycle of baseball bat" > 
  <img src="images/bouncing_ball.gif" width="855" height="480" alt="infinite loop of bouncing ballsy face in the western town" >

***And these are some of my 3D works.***


   <img src="images/tree.gif" width="855" height="480" alt="the turntable cycle of tree in glass container" ><img src="images/skateboard.gif" width="855" height="480" alt="the cycle of flipping skateboard" ><img src="images/mummy.jpg" width="855" height="480" alt="The mummy on its way to capture the lollypop" >
