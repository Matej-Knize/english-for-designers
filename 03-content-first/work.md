# My work

I love to make animations in all ways. <br>
I have started this journey with 2D and now I'm most into the 3D stuff where I have less limitations and can create literally anything I can imagine.<br>

***There are samples of my 2D animations from school work.***

***And these are some of my 3D works.***

In these days, I've been returning to architectural themes in my work, and finally, I'm slowly finding where I'd like to settle in my artistic career. Now I think, i would be nice to be a part of game dev. studio and creating some 3D stuff for them.

And there are fragments from my latest work.
