### I often think about *tomorrow*.

Since I was a child, I often delayed work for later. I did this to have more fun and I started using tomorrow as my favourite excuse. Every time some duty came up, I would just say: **tomorrow**... and so I made more time for fun and things I enjoyed more, like computer games. At one point, I kept saying *tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,* and then I played games, and had so many tasks that it became hard to catch up. I had to develop a new skill to perfectly determine how long I could delay tasks while still finishing them in term. That was my superpower.

But after finishing high school, I didn't need it as much anymore. I studied a field I truly enjoyed so most of my duties became enjoyable. My inner need to procrastinate everything for later no longer had such an application. I still occasionally postponed something boring, but when I heard the word tomorrow, I no longer heard it as an excuse. I perceived it as something positive. Tomorrow was like a sign of hope for me. It gave me the opportunity to be better than I was today. Tomorrow could bring anything—knowledge, money, love... everything. 

Even when there were ups or downs in my life, I always looked towards tomorrow. I truly believed it could bring something good and exciting. But then something changed again. 

From a certain moment, I can't precisely say when, I started looking at tomorrow completely differently. Suddenly, when I thought about it, anxiety struck me because I had no idea what it might bring, and I was afraid of it. Of course, it could still bring new love, experiences, or anything joyful, but I could only think that something bad would definitely happen. That tomorrow would not be the D-day when I finally meet my future wife. Even when someone said, "See you tomorrow," I wondered if there was any tomorrow left for me.

**So, I needed _another_ change.**

Now I am on my own spiritual journey to discover what tomorrow truly means. It still scares me. But now, I can see it even as something positive that could bring solutions to my problems and not only creating the new ones. And, of course, I haven't forgotten to use it as an excuses. In today's bussy world, it's pleasant to taking a break for myself, even if it means more work later.

In conclusion, I would just like to add that whatever tomorrow brings, good or bad, it's definitely worth waiting for because if a person gives up today, they might miss out on the best that life could offer, and it might just come right ***tomorrow...***
