Hi, I'm Matěj. I'm a student of animation and visual effects. Today, I want to share my journey of finding myself.
It all started in 6th grade. That's when I first realized I enjoyed creating things, painting, crafting, and writing poems and songs. I just liked being creative. At that time, I was already spending most of my school hours drawing pictures in my notebook or building catapults from pens instead of studying. During this time, I won my first creative contest. I did it by drawing the best comic about legends from Pilsen.
It was my first such success, but unfortunately, it was also my first life lesson. Never trust anyone :D. Sadly, I don’t even have a photo of my comic. I was told it would be displayed at the town hall with others after the contest, and then returned to me. However, that never happened, and I never saw it again.
Then there was a quieter period when I just created for myself. I mostly doodled in the margins of my notebooks. Soon, I had to decide where to go next in life and choose a high school.
I personally wanted to become an artistic woodcarver or a blacksmith, but under slight pressure from my parents, I found myself choosing between mechanical engineering and civil engineering. Eventually, civil engineering won. Creativity had to pause for a while, giving way to logic, charts, guidelines, and standards.
Although I somewhat enjoyed it and think I was quite good at it, it wasn’t truly satisfying. Soon, drawing took over again and I started looking for ways to release my creative tension. That’s when I first discovered the magic of 3D modeling, though still limited in its freedom. I began learning in 3D programs for designing buildings and really enjoyed it. I saw potential and started looking for ways to explore it more deeply. I decided to enroll in a voluntary architecture seminar. There, we did little 3D modeling. But, I discovered the magic of designing buildings. It combined everything I loved: drawing, making physical models, 3D modeling, and, most importantly, feeling like I was creating something new that mattered. Architecture consumed me so much. I decided to continue in this field after graduation. It was clear I wouldn’t become a construction manager or a structural engineer, but an architect.
I passed the talent exams and the next year, I started at the Faculty of Architecture at ČVUT, full of enthusiasm and anticipation. Everything seemed right. High school had prepared me well for the technical subjects. So, I could focus on the creative ones, which I enjoyed most. However, I was a bit unlucky with the professors at the main atelier subject. They suppressed our creativity and pushed all student designs in one direction. By the end of the semester, all our atelier's designs looked nearly the same. This was frustrating. I lost much of my motivation and passion for creation. The next semester, when they added math, I couldn’t push myself to continue and I ended up dropping out.
Then I looked for a job where I could apply my skills and soon became a sales specialist at a bathroom studio. I designed new bathrooms and renovations for customers. I could spend half the day drawing and designing in the office and get paid for it. That was great. But, then there was the other half of the day filling out many corporate spreadsheets and I hated that. So, I decided to give architecture another try.
I passed the talent exams again, thinking I could make it this time. However, a pandemic was happening. Along with other things, it led to me getting burnout and after two semesters, I left the faculty again. That completely closed the chapter on architecture for me. I didn’t know what I would do next, but I needed to pay the bills, so I took a job at a call center, selling car insurance over the phone. The money was good, and I lived quite comfortably during that time, but I still felt a lack of creativity inside. From Monday to Friday, the days looked the same, and I didn’t enjoy that. It was time to be a poor student again.
I quit my job and decided to study animation and VFX. At that time, I was convinced I would pursue a career in filmmaking after school because that’s what led me to the field. However, by the end of the first year, it was clear that while animation was fun, animating more complex things like characters didn’t excite me at all. But I had the opportunity to return to 3D modeling, this time with complete freedom to create anything. I dedicated most of the second year to it. Although I enjoyed it, something was still missing. I can’t fully explain it, but something just wasn’t right. I continued searching and got the chance to work on several projects making visualizations. I could use all my new skills and combine them with old ones from architecture. And honestly, I enjoyed it and am still working on similar projects today.
But it still isn’t 100% right. Visualizations are definitely something I will continue to pursue, but it’s not my main interest. The search continues.
Lately, I have been getting into procedural 3D modeling. It gives me a bit more freedom than traditional 3D, and I think this might finally be it. But who knows… maybe it’s just another step towards finding what I will enjoy the most.
What I really want to say is that it’s okay not to know what you want to do in life, regardless of your age. But it’s important not to stay in one place and to keep searching for what makes you happy. If you feel that where you are isn’t the right place, don’t be afraid to move, I believe it will be worth it.
But also think of a backup plan, we don’t want to end up on the street
