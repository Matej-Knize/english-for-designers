Hello, today I would like to introduce the topic of my bachelor thesis. I will focus on the use of virtual reality in history education. Within this topic, I'd like to explore the possibility of using virtual reality to transport students directly to the scenes of significant historical events. I aim to investigate the best ways to achieve this and the options currently available. My goal is to lay the groundwork for an alternative method of teaching history through animation, 3D scenes, and virtual reality. Furthermore, I would like to outline the possible practical applications in school settings.
I chose this topic because it is somewhat personal to me. I have always enjoyed history, but learning it was a struggle because it mostly involved the dry memorization of dates and names, which I have never been good at. I am more of a visual learner and need to connect things with an experience or emotion to remember them well. Therefore, rote learning from books never really worked for me, and even though I find history very interesting, I always had trouble remembering even the basic events. I want to connect the teaching of history with emotions and allow students to experience important historical moments for themselves, turning them into easily memorable intense memories, rather than a dull line of text in a textbook.
I hope that such an approach to learning will one day become standard in our schools, making school not only more fun but also more effective, and ensuring that our past is not forgotten.
Thank you for your attention.
