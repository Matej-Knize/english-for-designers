## Voice:
*	Honest - I don't like lying and dishonesty, so I always try to be as honest as possible. However, I don't do this at the cost of hurting someone. A merciful lie, if it's not too big, can sometimes be better than the truth. But I always try to avoid it if possible.
*	Friendly - I try to be nice to others so that they feel good around me and have fun. I often joke about things and if it's within my power, I try to always be helpful to others.
*	Sarcastic - I often use sarcasm to lighten the mood because it's my style of humor. Sometimes my sarcasm is so good that people think I'm serious, which can sometimes be a problem. (I'm working on this).
## Tone:
*	Informal - I don't care much for formal speech. If the situation requires it, I can manage, but I prefer to speak casually and I don't mind using a swear word occasionally to make the speech flow better.
*	Phlegmatic - Although I'm actually quite emotional, I've learned to act calmly and thoughtfully in tense situations. It's always better to pause and solve everything with humor than to get unnecessarily upset. However, sometimes I lose my temper and shout. After all, we are all just people :)
*	Optimistic - Even in the worst situations, I try to find something good and always believe that things will get better and everything will turn out well. I often annoy people with this, but I think the world needs a bit of positivity.
## Style:
*	Emojis - Whenever possible, I put emojis after every sentence :D I feel it makes the text more enriched with emotions and not so serious.
*	Long sentences - I often get carried away by the thought I want to express and create long compound sentences. I just let the text flow as it comes to my mind and forget to think about how I should divide it to make it understandable for the other person.
*	Simple - I prefer simple words, so I can express my thoughts quickly. No need for fancy words.
