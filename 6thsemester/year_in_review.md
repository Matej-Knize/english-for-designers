# My last year review.
The last year was quite intense. It was my final school year at this institution, which brought many duties and stress, but also many new experiences and knowledge. Not always did these responsibilities go hand in hand with my procrastination, so I decided to extend for another semester. This was to gain not only more time to work on my bachelor's thesis but also to organize my life. Until now, I have been working as a stagehand, and although I have been quite successful, it is time to fully commit to my career in the arts. Thus, I started gradually seeking commissions for visualizations and similar projects, hoping to soon fill my portfolio and work full-time in a creative environment next year. At the same time, I began to plan moving out of the dormitory to find my own apartment.

As for English, despite being unlucky with illnesses last semester and missing many classes, I honestly think it was the best English clases I have experienced, and I am very grateful for it. It not only helped me partly overcome my fear of speaking a foreign language but also gave me many opportunities to reflect on myself and where I want to go next.
For that, I owe you my thanks.
